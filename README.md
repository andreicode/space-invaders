## Workflow:
1. Make sure that you are on the master branch: `git checkout master`
2. Keep master up to date: `git pull origin master`
3. Create the feature branch using this template: `git checkout -b feature__subfeature--state`
4. Push the branch: `git add .`, `git commit -m 'update'` and `git push origin branch_name`
5. Get back to the master branch: `git checkout master`

### **Please make sure that every new branch is started from the master branch - keep every feature on a separate branch**
